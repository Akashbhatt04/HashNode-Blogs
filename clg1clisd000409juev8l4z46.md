**Git is a version control system that helps developers manage changes to their code. GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides additional features like collaboration tools, issue tracking, and more.**

**Here are some basic Git commands to get started:**

```plaintext
git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
```

```plaintext
git clone [url]: Clones a remote Git repository to your local machine.
```

```plaintext
git add [file]: Adds a file or changes to the staging area.
```

```plaintext
git commit -m "[message]": Commits changes with a message describing the changes made.
```

```plaintext
git push: Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.
```

```plaintext
git pull: Pulls changes from a remote repository to your local machine.
```

```

```plaintext
git branch: Lists all local branches in the current repository.
```

```plaintext
git checkout [branch]: Switches to the specified branch.
```

```plaintext
git merge [branch]: Merges the specified branch with the current branch.
```

**Some additional commands that may be useful:**
