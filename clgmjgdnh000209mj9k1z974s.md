In Jenkins, a multistage pipeline is a way of defining a build pipeline that consists of multiple stages, where each stage represents a distinct step in the pipeline. Each stage is defined using a block of code in the pipeline script and can be assigned a unique name.

Here's an example of a simple multistage pipeline in Jenkins:

```bash
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Building..."'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Testing..."'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Deploying..."'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the pipeline has three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. Each stage has a single step, which runs a shell command that simply echoes a message.

The `agent` directive specifies where the pipeline should be run. In this case, we're using `any`, which means the pipeline can run on any available agent.

The `stages` directive is a list of stages that make up the pipeline. Each stage can have one or more steps, which are defined using the `steps` directive. In this example, each stage has only one step.

Overall, declarative pipelines provide a powerful and flexible way to define and manage your CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins and can be customized in a variety of ways to meet your specific needs.
